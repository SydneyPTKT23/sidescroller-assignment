# sidescroller-assignment

Done from the base of the given Unity tutorial. Download the project as a zip file, add to Unity Hub from disk and build project. Unlike the tutorial, I used 
CharacterController instead of RigidBody, because dynamic physics weren't necessary for the simple project. Besides player controls, the game was done along the 
tutorial's directions.

CONTROLS:

- Space to jump.
- Avoid fences or you lose.
